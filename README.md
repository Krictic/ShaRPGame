# ShaRPGame

This is my second attempt at building a text-based RPG game using OOP principles and a MVC design pattern.

This is not intended to be a deep gaming experience nor to be a balanced or even "fun" experience, this is primarily a learning project for myself to deepen my knowledge of programming and project design.

I´ve realized my mistake in the last project, ShaRPG, was to rely heavily on inheritance, resulting in deeply coupled code which made it very hard to refactor. Therefore, after consulting with coders who are more experienced than I, i´ve decided on use composition, not inheritance. To do this i´ve decided upon the usage of interfaces to create classes categories which can be implemented on multiple classes and, on the other side, allow for classes to implement multiple interfaces, something that, as far I am aware, would not be possible using inheritance.

If you have any suggestions and comments ont his project, pelase send me a message.

Thank you.
